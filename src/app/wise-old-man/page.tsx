      <p>
        In this video I will be looking into the Jungian wise old man archetype,
        what it is and what purpose it serves, along with strategies using what
        we will call the masculine K strategy. I will use the term{" "}
        <strong>wise old man</strong> as it is easier to understand. You should
        probably also watch my r/K selection and Jung’s archetypes video to
        quickly understand what archetypes there are and what they are for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wise old man archetype is how our brains alter our behaviour in
        order to survive in a stressful yet stable environment.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">
        Core Emotions of the Archetype
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Admirable</li>
        <li>Heroic</li>
        <li>Protective</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Admiration is the emotion used to try and absorb traits or behaviours
        from someone admirable. Heroism is a form of admiration, and protection
        is often perceived as both admirable and heroic.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">
        Admirable Actions
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Sacrificing your life to protect innocents.</li>
        <li>Surviving a difficult task.</li>
        <li>Living a long time.</li>
        <li>Surviving with minimal resources.</li>
        <li>Abstract intelligence (especially spatial intelligence).</li>
        <li>Humour, which is linked to abstract intelligence.</li>
        <li>Being tall (indicator of resilience).</li>
        <li>Lighter skin (perceived adaptation to harsh environments).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These traits define the wise old man archetype, seen in religious and
        mythological figures like Jesus, Horus, Gandalf, and Luke Skywalker.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">
        Neurobiology & Evolution
      </h2>
      <p>
        Admiration is tied to a mental circuit that values traits which survive
        across time. This reflects environmental selection and connects to the
        idea of God — the ideal survivor: immortal, omniscient, and
        all-powerful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Humans embody this archetype more than other species due to our
        intelligence and long-term adaptability. In stable yet challenging
        environments, people emulate the wise old man archetype, aligning with
        hard work and delayed rewards.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">Modern Contrast</h2>
      <p>
        Our softened society leans toward the{" "}
        <strong>r feminine strategy</strong>, linked with the Baphomet archetype
        — the deceiver. Mutations and societal changes reduce adherence to the K
        masculine strategy, which emphasizes adaptability and long-term
        thinking.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">
        K Masculine Archetype
      </h2>
      <p>
        The K masculine traits are fundamentally adaptive — optimized for
        survival across time. Some view this environmental selection as a divine
        process. Hence, the wise old man is also seen as the archetype of God —
        the ultimate survivor and protector.
      </p>

      <p>
        To evaluate someone: ask yourself, “Is this behaviour adaptive in
        healthy, good males?” If yes, then the behaviour likely reflects the
        wise old man archetype.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700">
        Masculinity & God
      </h2>
      <p>
        This archetype appears masculine because men are biologically more
        disposable — fewer reproductive consequences upon death. While admirable
        women exist, extreme outliers tend to be men. Thus, the archetype is
        visualized as a tall, old man with a beard.
      </p>

      <p className="italic">
        In essence, the wise old man is the god of adaptation, protection, and
        sacrifice.
